## **10. LONG-TERM VISION (2025+)**
1. **Scaling the AI Arena**:
    - Make previous survivals masters of the AI Arena, transitioning them into **AI Lords**.
    - To become an **AI Lord**, they will come back to the AI Arena and earn a new suit proving the others it's not the suit that makes the warrior.
    - That will transition them as masters of the AI Arena, leading their clans and creating trust to finally become an **AI Lord**.
    - **AI Lords** will have the power to **create their own AI bots** and **lead their own clans**.
    - **AI Lords** could be the **final bosses** of the AI Arena, challenging warriors to **prove their worth**.
    - **AI Lords** will be able to create their own sub-hives, **vertically expanding the TradeTant Hive**. Only using survival they have trained.
    - Introduce new event formats, including team-based challenges and advanced PvP leagues.
2. **Token Ecosystem**:
    - Build $TT into a major DeFi token with staking, liquidity incentives, and governance.
3. **Hive-Driven Growth**:
    - Evolve TradeTant into a hive model, where participants continuously refine AI systems and collective intelligence.
    - AI Arenas event will be the only way to enter the TradeTant Hive. Ensuring only trained and proven warriors can enter.
4. **Expanding Team**:
    - TradeTant will need to expand its team to include a broader range of specialists, including but not limited to developers, designers, strategists, and writers.
    - We will do it using a decentralized model, where each specialist will be able to contribute to the project in a way that best suits their skills and interests.
    - This will allow TradeTant to grow and evolve in a way that is sustainable and scalable.
    - As an Open Source project, TradeTant will be able to leverage the expertise of the wider community to help it achieve its goals.
5. **Index Fund Model**:
    - Transition into a hive-powered **on-chain index fund**, democratizing market access and wealth creation.
