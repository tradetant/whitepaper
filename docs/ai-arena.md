## **4. THE AI ARENA: A NEW BATTLEFIELD**
The **AI Arena** is not just a competitionâ€”it is a **quarterly war** where **1000 warriors** are selected to fight against AI-driven markets. Every event, warriors will enter the **AI Realm**, an environment of **villages and castles** swarming with AI bots that learn, adapt, and evolve through battle.

The objective? **Extract the wealth, conquer the AI Realm, and defeat the King.**

### **4.1. Token Distribution & The AI Realm**
Every **AI Arena event** begins with a total of **1 Billion $TT Tokens**, distributed as follows:

- **100M $TT** is directly allocated to the **1000 warriors** (each warrior starts with 100K tokens).
- **900M $TT** is locked inside the AI Realm, split into:
    - **567M $TT in the Villages** (increasing difficulty)
    - **333M $TT in the Castle** (final showdown)

| **Villages (567M)** |  **Castle (333M)** |
|----------------------|--------------------|
| 2M (Village 1)  | 1M (Castle Floor 1)  |
| 11M (Village 2) | 2M (Castle Floor 2)  |
| 17M (Village 3) | 7M (Castle Floor 3)  |
| 25M (Village 4) | 13M (Castle Floor 4) |
| 33M (Village 5) | 30M (Castle Floor 5) |
| 96M (Village 6) | 70M (Castle Floor 6) |
| 383M (Village 7) | 210M (Castle Floor 7) |

Each **village conquered** gives warriors access to the **next level**, where the difficultyâ€”and the potential rewardsâ€”**increase exponentially**.

### **4.2. WAR MECHANICS & WEALTH EXTRACTION**
#### **4.2.1. The Two Game Modes**
**To extract wealth from the villages and castle floors, warriors have two paths:**

#### **ðŸ’€ 1:1 Mode - The Survival Path**
- Warriors **bet** an amount.
- If they **win**, they take **double** their bet.
- If they **lose**, they lose the entire amount.
- A perfect way for **risk-takers** to prove their skill.

#### **ðŸ§  1:X Mode - The AI Feeding Path**
- Warriors **bet** against the AI.
- If they **lose**, they only pay what they bet.
- If they **win**, they take **X times** their bet (depending on the village).
- The **catch?** Warriors must **submit their AI model weights** as paymentâ€”improving the AI they just fought **and** the corresponding knight of the castle.
- **Example:** Beating Village 3 means **training Castle Floor 3â€™s AI**, making future battles harder.

| **Village** | **Multiplier (X)** |
|------------|----------------|
| Village 1 | x50 |
| Village 2 | x30 |
| Village 3 | x20 |
| Village 4 | x10 |
| Village 5 | x7 |
| Village 6 | x5 |
| Village 7 | x3 |

This mechanic ensures **progressive AI evolution**, making **each AI Arena event harder than the last**.

#### **4.2.2. The Clans & Live-Streaming Battles**

#### **4.2.2. Clan-Based Collaboration**
Warriors **must be part of a Clan** to enter the Arena. Clans will **collaborate, strategize, and develop unique AI strategies** to take on the AI forces.

- **Spartans:** Risk-heavy strategies.
- **Wakandias:** Stealth arbitrage.
- **Jedis:** Predictive analytics.  
  **All clans unite** to extract wealth from AI Bots and storm the Castle.

Within the AI Arena, **Clans will compete** to see who can extract the most wealth from the AI Realm.
Warriors can also have PvP battles with other clans using 1:1 game mode. As a PvP Colosseum but warriors will lose tokens unlike friendly battles. 

#### **4.2.3. Live-Streaming Battles**
**Live-streaming battles is encouraged**, fostering **real-time audience engagement** and growing support for warriors.

### **4.3. The AI King & The Final Showdown**
The **AI King** resides in the Castle, guarded by the most advanced AI in the Realm. To reach the King, warriors must conquer all seven villages and **defeat the Castle Floors**.

- **The Castle Floors:** Each floor is guarded by a **Castle Knight**, an AI that learns from the warriorsâ€™ strategies.
- **The Knights and the King:** Will only fight 1 warrior at a time.
- **The Knight:** The main difference between the Castle Knight and the AI Bot is that the Knight learns from the strategies of the warriors who have defeated it. This means that the Castle Knight will adapt to the strategies of the warriors, making it harder to defeat.
- **The King:** The King is the final boss of the AI Arena. The King is the most advanced AI in the AI Realm and is the ultimate challenge for the warriors. The King is the key to unlocking the wealth of the Castle.

This means for **The Final Showdown** Only the most skilled warriors will reach the King, and only the strongest will defeat him.

### **4.4. Outcomes for Warriors:**
- **Tokens ($TT):** Rewards for successful battles.
- **Reputation:** Grow their standing in the community.
- **Experience:** Collaboration, learning, and preparation for the real market.
