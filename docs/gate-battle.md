# **2. THE GATE BATTLE: UNLOCKING HUMAN INSTINCTS**
The **Gate Battle** is not just a test—it is the **first training ground** for every aspiring warrior.  
Most traders have **dormant instincts**—TradeTant’s goal is to **awaken them** and **forge unshakable trust** in their own decision-making.  
This is where **peasants become warriors.**

---

## **2.1. Structure: 5 Stages, 5 Timeframes Each**
To prove their worth, warriors must **fight AI in 25 battles** across **5 progressive stages (sessions)**. Each stage consists of **5 timeframes**, where traders must **predict price movements** across increasing difficulty levels.

The **progressive stacking of chart details** ensures that warriors develop their ability to instinctively understand patterns, starting with simple visualizations and advancing to complex market data.

### **Stage-by-Stage Breakdown**
Each stage introduces new layers of complexity, simulating real-world trading conditions while progressively challenging the warrior’s instincts and decision-making skills.

#### **Stage 1: Average Price Line**
- **Chart Type:** A single line representing the **average price movement** over time.
- **Objective:** Predict the next price movement based solely on the trend of the average price line.
- **AI Assistance:** None. Warriors rely purely on their instincts.
- **Skills Trained:** Basic pattern recognition and trend identification.

#### **Stage 2: Average Price Line + Volume Blocks**
- **Chart Type:** The average price line is now accompanied by **volume blocks** that indicate trading activity.
- **Objective:** Incorporate volume data into predictions, identifying whether high or low volume correlates with price changes.
- **AI Assistance:** The first AI Piece (earned in Stage 1) provides a **suggested prediction line** that can be adjusted by the warrior.
- **Skills Trained:** Understanding the relationship between price and volume, refining intuition for market momentum.

#### **Stage 3: Average Price Line + Volume Blocks + Candlesticks**
- **Chart Type:** Adds **candlestick charts** to the previous elements, showing open, close, high, and low prices for each timeframe.
- **Objective:** Predict price movements using candlestick patterns, volume, and the average price line.
- **AI Assistance:** The second AI Piece (earned in Stage 2) enhances the suggested prediction line, incorporating candlestick analysis.
- **Skills Trained:** Reading candlestick patterns, combining multiple data points for more accurate predictions.

#### **Stage 4: Full Candlestick Chart + Volume + Indicators**
- **Chart Type:** Includes all previous elements, plus **technical indicators** such as moving averages, RSI, and MACD.
- **Objective:** Use technical indicators alongside candlestick patterns and volume to predict price movements.
- **AI Assistance:** The third AI Piece (earned in Stage 3) integrates indicator-based predictions, offering a more sophisticated analysis.
- **Skills Trained:** Interpreting technical indicators, developing a holistic view of market conditions.

#### **Stage 5: Full Chaos Trading**
- **Chart Type:** Simulates **real-world market volatility**, including sudden spikes, dips, and erratic price movements.
- **Objective:** Adapt to unpredictable market conditions, relying on instincts honed in earlier stages.
- **AI Assistance:** The fourth AI Piece (earned in Stage 4) provides dynamic, real-time predictions, but warriors must decide when to trust the AI and when to override it.
- **Skills Trained:** Decision-making under pressure, balancing human intuition with AI-driven insights.

## **2.2. How Each Battle Works**
- **Interaction:** The **user clicks on the chart** to **draw their predicted price curve** for the next timeframe.
- **AI Bot Prediction:** The **AI Bot simultaneously generates its own prediction**, which is compared against the user’s input.
- **Tolerance Measurement:** A **+/- 5% tolerance** is applied, measuring **closeness to reality**.
    - If both the user and AI are out of range for **the majority of the intervals**, the set is **replayed**.
    - **Winning a battle improves the user’s final score for that stage.**
    - **Losing a stage (total score for the 5 timeframes) removes 1 life.**
    - If they **tie**, they **play again** the **set** in which their **scores were closest**.

- **Live Market Feed:** Each battle starts when the user interacts with a live market feed, ensuring **real-world unpredictability**.

- **Consequences of Failure:**
    - If a warrior **loses all 5 lives**, their **deposit is unlocked for withdrawal**.
    - If the user **withdraws their deposit**, any progress (stages won) **will also be deleted**.

## **2.3. Capturing AI & Building the AI Suit**
Each **AI Bot defeated** becomes **a part of the user’s AI Suit**, granting **new abilities and strategic advantages** in the next battles.

### **AI Suit Evolution Through Training**
The **AI Suit** is not just a static tool—it evolves dynamically based on the warrior’s performance and decisions during the Gate Battle.

#### **AI Piece Mechanics**
- **Training Data:** Each AI Piece is trained on the warrior’s **battle data**, including successful predictions, failed attempts, and adjustments made to AI suggestions.
- **Skill Integration:** As warriors progress through stages, the AI Suit learns to integrate new skills:
    - **Stage 1 AI Piece:** Focuses on **basic trend identification**.
    - **Stage 2 AI Piece:** Adds **volume analysis** capabilities.
    - **Stage 3 AI Piece:** Incorporates **candlestick pattern recognition**.
    - **Stage 4 AI Piece:** Introduces **indicator-based predictions**.
    - **Stage 5 AI Piece:** Specializes in **adaptive decision-making** under chaotic conditions.

#### **Synergistic Learning Effect**
The AI Suit’s evolution creates a **synergetic learning effect**, teaching warriors:
- **What abilities the AI Suit offers.**
- **When to trust the AI Suit and when to rely on instincts.**
- **How to combine their own intuition with AI-driven decisions.**

| **Stage Cleared** | **AI Suit Power Unlocked** | **Skills Enhanced** |
|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| **Stage 1**        | AI-assisted Market Awareness | Trend identification |
| **Stage 2**        | Pattern Recognition Augment | Volume analysis |
| **Stage 3**        | Price Action Precision      | Candlestick patterns |
| **Stage 4**        | AI-Integrated Decision Support | Indicator-based predictions |
| **Stage 5**        | Fully Functional AI Suit    | Adaptive decision-making |

## **2.4. Technical Details of AI Training**
The AI Suit’s training process is designed to mirror the warrior’s progression through the Gate Battle, ensuring that the AI evolves in tandem with the user’s skills.

### **Training Workflow**
1. **Data Collection:**
    - Each battle generates data on the warrior’s predictions, AI suggestions, and actual market outcomes.
    - This data is used to train the corresponding AI Piece.

2. **Model Architecture:** (Initial suggestions, subject to change)
    - **Stage 1 AI Piece:** Simple linear regression model for trend identification.
    - **Stage 2 AI Piece:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for volume analysis.
    - **Stage 3 AI Piece:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for candlestick pattern recognition.
    - **Stage 4 AI Piece:** Hybrid model combining CNNs and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for indicator-based predictions.
    - **Stage 5 AI Piece:** Reinforcement Learning (RL) model for adaptive decision-making.

3. **Feedback Loop:**
    - The AI Suit continuously learns from the warrior’s decisions, adjusting its predictions to align with the user’s evolving strategy.

4. **Integration:**
    - Once all five AI Pieces are earned, they are integrated into a **unified AI Suit**, capable of handling complex, real-world trading scenarios.
