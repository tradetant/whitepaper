# **2. THE GATE BATTLE: UNLOCKING HUMAN INSTINCTS**
The **Gate Battle** is not just a test—it is the **first training ground** for every aspiring warrior.

Most traders have **slept instincts**—TradeTant’s goal is to **awaken them** and **forge unshakable trust** in their own decision-making.

This is where **peasants become warriors.**

---

### **2.1. Structure: 5 Stages, 5 Timeframes Each**
To prove their worth, warriors must **fight AI in 25 battles** across **5 progressive difficulties (stages).**

Each stage consists of **5 timeframes** where traders must **predict price movements** across increasing difficulty levels.

| **Stage** | **Timeframes (Battles per Stage)** | **Challenge** | **Difficulty** |
|-----------|---------------------------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Stage 1** | 5s, 10s, 30s, 1m, 5m | Predict price movement | Simple moving average |
| **Stage 2** | 5s, 10s, 30s, 1m, 5m | Spot the trend shift | Early fluctuations |
| **Stage 3** | 5s, 10s, 30s, 1m, 5m | Draw the next candles | Price action reading |
| **Stage 4** | 5s, 10s, 30s, 1m, 5m | Volume-integrated trading | Real market conditions |
| **Stage 5** | 5s, 10s, 30s, 1m, 5m | Full chaos trading | Mimicking real volatility |

Each timeframe set is **an independent battle**, allowing traders to **experience short-term and mid-term thinking** within the same difficulty level before moving forward.

This structure **extracts deep-seated instincts**, training the warrior **progressively in live conditions.**

### **2.2. How Each Battle Works**
- The **user clicks on the chart** to **draw their predicted price curve** for the next timeframe.
- The **AI Bot simultaneously generates its own prediction.**
- A **+/- 5% tolerance is applied**, measuring **closeness to reality**.
- If both are out of range for **the majority of the intervals**, the set is **replayed.**
- **Winning a battle improves the user’s final score for that stage.**
- **Losing a stage (total score for the 5 timeframes) removes 1 life.**
- If they **tie**, they **play again** the **set** in which their **scores were closest**.

Each battle **starts when the user interacts with a live market feed**, ensuring **real-world unpredictability.**

If a warrior **loses all 5 lives**, their **deposit is unlocked for withdrawal** and their progress is wiped.

If the user **withdraws their deposit**, any progress (stages won) **will also be deleted.**

---

### **2.3. Capturing AI & Building the AI Suit**
Each **AI Bot defeated** becomes **a part of the user’s AI Suit**, granting **new abilities and strategic advantages** in the next battles.

This creates a **synergetic learning effect**, teaching warriors:
- **What abilities the AI Suit offers.**
- **When to trust the AI Suit and when to rely on instincts.**
- **How to combine their own intuition with AI-driven decisions.**

| **Stage Cleared** | **AI Suit Power Unlocked** |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Stage 1** | AI-assisted Market Awareness |
| **Stage 2** | Pattern Recognition Augment |
| **Stage 3** | Price Action Precision |
| **Stage 4** | AI-Integrated Decision Support |
| **Stage 5** | Fully Functional AI Suit |

By **Stage 5**, warriors are no longer **just traders**—they have **trained AI as an extension of themselves.**

This AI Suit will **define their journey inside the AI Arena.**
