# **Prize Distribution Options**

The **prize pool** for each AI Arena event is distributed among survivors based on their final $AIA token holdings. Below are the three proposed distribution options, along with their pros and cons.

---

## **Option 1: Automatic Split & Distribution Using SOL**

#### **Mechanics**
- The prize pool remains as a **vault of SOL** throughout the event.
- At the end of the event, the vault is automatically split among survivors based on their final $AIA token holdings.

#### **Pros**
- **Simplicity:** No additional token conversions or market interactions are required.
- **Transparency:** Warriors know exactly how much SOL they will receive based on their performance.
- **Immediate Liquidity:** Winners receive SOL directly, which can be used immediately for trading or staking.

#### **Cons**
- **Limited Market Impact:** This approach does not contribute to the growth of $TT or $AIA tokens, potentially limiting long-term ecosystem benefits.
- **No Community Engagement:** It does not incentivize broader participation or engagement with the TradeTant ecosystem.

## **Option 2: Buy the Prize Pool in $TT Tokens and Split**

#### **Mechanics**
- The prize pool is converted into **$TT tokens** at the start of the event.
- At the end of the event, the total $TT tokens purchased are distributed among survivors based on their $AIA token holdings.

#### **Pros**
- **Supports Token Growth:** Injecting liquidity into $TT promotes its value and adoption within the ecosystem.
- **Encourages Staking:** Warriors receiving $TT tokens can stake them, further integrating them into the TradeTant economy.
- **Alignment with Goals:** Reinforces the importance of $TT as the backbone of the ecosystem.

#### **Cons**
- **Market Volatility Risk:** The value of $TT tokens may fluctuate during the event, creating uncertainty for winners.
- **Complexity:** Requires converting the prize pool into $TT tokens, adding an extra step to the process.

## **Option 3: Use the Prize Pool as a Liquidity Pool for $AIA Tokens**

#### **Mechanics**
- The prize pool is used to create a **liquidity pool** for $AIA tokens.
- Survivors receive a share of the liquidity pool proportional to their $AIA token holdings.
- The **staking mechanism** is modified to include $AIA tokens, enabling warriors to use their AI Suits in real-world trading.

#### **Pros**
- **Community Engagement:** Each event becomes an opportunity for the community to engage with a new market ($AIA tokens).
- **Long-Term Benefits:** A robust liquidity pool enhances the stability and attractiveness of $AIA tokens.
- **Warrior Empowerment:** Survivors become strong holders of $AIA tokens, fostering loyalty and trust within the ecosystem.

#### **Cons**
- **Staking Complexity:** Modifying the staking mechanism to include $AIA tokens adds complexity to the system.
- **Risk of Centralization:** If too few warriors hold large amounts of $AIA tokens, it could lead to centralization risks.
- **Adoption Challenges:** New participants may find it difficult to understand and engage with the liquidity pool concept.

## **Final Considerations**

Choosing the right distribution path depends on TradeTant’s priorities:

- **Short-Term Simplicity:** If the focus is on simplicity and immediate rewards, **Option 1 (SOL Vault)** is the best choice.
- **Ecosystem Growth:** If the goal is to promote $TT token adoption and align rewards with the ecosystem’s goals, **Option 2 ($TT Tokens)** is ideal.
- **Long-Term Sustainability:** If TradeTant aims to build a self-sustaining ecosystem with high community engagement, **Option 3 ($AIA Liquidity Pool)** offers the most potential but requires careful implementation.
